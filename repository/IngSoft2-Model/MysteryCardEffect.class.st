Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  Gives a random card to the spaceship that lands on it

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
